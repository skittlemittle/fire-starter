No one knows how Endsville, the city of devils, was created, but as soon as it appeared, it started
to grow, and slowly eat up the world. You are an agent of Canti, the god of the black flame, and you
must stop Endsville from destroying the world. Your only weapon is flame: matches, lighters, and
fire-bombs.
Get the weapons, outsmart the firefighters, hide from the police, torch the city, and purge its devils.
But you must be careful; you cannot burn everything. If the entire city burns down, there will be
no place to live. Thus, the battle is hopeless: there is no final victory. The only thing you can do
is burn and burn and burn.
Your highest goal is to receive the personal blessing of Canti, the god of the black flame.
